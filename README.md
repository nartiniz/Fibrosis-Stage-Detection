# Fibrosis-Stage-Detection
In this project, a neural network model is implemented for detecting fibrosis stages of patients, from laboratory results. 
data2.mat file contains all laboratory results of patients. In which, there are numerous features including age, weight, height, hypertension, blood pressure, fibroscan results etc.
There are 5 different levels of fibrosis stages from 0 to 4. But in the code, we impelemt binary classification amon groups 0-1 and 2-4. 
For the real data, instead of mat file, feel free to contact me.
